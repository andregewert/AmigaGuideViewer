# AmigaGuideViewer
Small and simple application for viewing AmigaGuide files.

This software was developed "quick and dirty" in about two days -- because I
needed (or at least wanted) anything to view AmigaGuide files on Linux directly
without converting them to other formats. It's not really feature complete yet
(support for word wrapping and some other functions are missing) but it should
render most guides quite well.

AmigaGuideViewer is implemented in Java (14) and should work on Window / Linux /
MacOS.
